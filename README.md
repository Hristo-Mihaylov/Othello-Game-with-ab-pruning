# Othello-Game-with-ab-pruning
To an already made basic Othello game, in which the user plays versus a computer. To make the computer almost unbeatable, I implemented a static evaluation function, a minimax-val function with ab-pruning, and a minimax function which returns the best possible move, given a paramether of a search depth.
